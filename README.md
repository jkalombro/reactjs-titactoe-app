This project was created using ReactJS and Redux.

## Tic-Tac-Toe App

This is a simple turn-based, two player app that allows user to play Tic-Tac-Toe.
I created my own algorithms to evaluate round and match results. It was a challenge but quite fulfilling to see when it is already running.

Just read the ingame instructions for further details on how to play the game.
Try to win a round 10 times to explore the whole app content.
